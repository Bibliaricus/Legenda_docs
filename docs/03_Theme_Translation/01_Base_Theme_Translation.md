**Included Language Files**

Before starting your own translation you may check pre-created language files of the Legenda theme (Legenda_Ecommerce_Responsive_WordPress_Theme > Translation_files). All these files have been contributed by our users that's why the amount of translated strings might vary.
Place these files into the languages /wp-content/languages/themes/ folder. Save the files with your language name and legenda theme suffix, e.g legenda-de_DE.po, legenda-de_DE.mo. Go to Loco Translate > Themes > Legenda > edit your translation and press Sync button first. Save changes. Check the frontend and continue translation if some strings are still missing.

**Using the Loco Translate plugin**

Go to  Plugins > Add new > install and activate the [Loco Translate plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/).
Go to  Loco Translate > Themes > select XStore theme. Press "Add new language". Translate strings and Save.

**Using PoEdit**

The translation file legenda.pot is in the Translation Files folder in the theme package. Edit the .po file using [POEdit](https://poedit.net/), and use the translation field to make replacements.  
From the file menu, save the file with your language name and legenda theme suffix, e.g legenda-de_DE.po. It will generate both a .po and .mo files for your translation. Place these files into the languages /wp-content/languages/themes/ folder.
