Nothing stands still; updates for WP and plugins are constantly being released, and they are included in our template. We constantly update our theme with new features and fix outstanding issues. You can check the changelog [here](https://themeforest.net/item/legenda-responsive-multipurpose-wordpress-theme/5888906?s_rank=7). We recommend using the latest theme version to avoid any issues associated with incorrect template functioning. Whenever the theme is updated, files will be rewritten. If you have made any changes to the updated files, those changes will be lost. Therefore, if you are planning to customize your template, you are advised to use the Child Theme, or the Custom CSS area in Theme Options if your changes only affect CSS styles. Theme updates only affect the theme files, and do not affect the database. To avoid difficulties, backup the theme files and database before any update.

**Backup**

Please, do the backup of your database and files before starting theme update. <br />
There are many plugins to backup the site:  <br />
\- [UpdraftPlus WordPress Backup Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/) <br />

\- [All-in-One WP Migration](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/) <br />
