By default, WordPress displays your content in a blog format on the homepage. If, however, you wish to create a separate page for blog posts, do the following: <br />
\- Navigate to Pages > Add New. You can title this page as Blog. <br />
\- Then go to Settings > Reading, and under the Front page displays option choose A static page. <br />
\- Below that, choose the page to be used as the front page, and the page for your blog posts. <br />
\- Save your changes, and load your site to review them. <br />
