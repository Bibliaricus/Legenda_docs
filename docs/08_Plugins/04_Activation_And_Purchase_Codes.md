The plugins included with our theme are external. We have purchased an Extended License for each of these plugins. They are fully functional and should run perfectly.  

The latest plugin versions are always available. You can find them in the theme folder, and you can get them directly from us. Simply login to your account on our site <http://www.8theme.com/my-account/>, go to the <https://www.8theme.com/downloads/> page, enter your purchase code, and you'll be granted access to the appropriate archives. 

Registering these plugins registration is not necessary. They will function perfectly without any need for activation.

The plugin activation option was added only for those who need to get automatic updates and support directly from plugin developers. If you need this option, you will first need to purchase and register the plugin.
