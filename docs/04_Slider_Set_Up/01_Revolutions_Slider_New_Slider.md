Legenda theme supports [Revolution Slider](https://revolution.themepunch.com/), which is installed after theme activation. 

In case if automatic plugin installation fails (as a rule it is because of your server settings), you can install it manually via your Dashboard: Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin > Browse plugin archive. Or via FTP, by uploading and extracting the plugin zip file into wp-content/plugins folder. <br />
You can find the zip files for plugins installation [here](https://www.8theme.com/downloads/).

You may at that time create the sliders and use them on the site in accordance with the plugin documentation. Refer to [Revolution Slider Documentation](https://www.themepunch.com/revslider-doc/slider-revolution-documentation/) for further information about slider settings. Sliders can be added to any page.

If you want to create a new slider, navigate to Revolution Slider > New Slider. You will reach a form where you will be prompted to enter the Sliders Basic Settings. The next step is creating/editing slides. Insert the slider content.
