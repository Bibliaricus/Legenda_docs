General information on how to create different types of products are located in the [WooCommerce documentation](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/managing-products/).

You can modify a single product page using the [Main Theme Options](/Theme_Installation/Main_Theme_Options). 


Also, each product has its [own settings](http://olya.8theme.com/theme-docs/legenda-docs/Theme_Installation/Page_Post_Product_Layout_settings).

**Brands** <br />
If you are selling branded products and want to show the brand image on a single product page, enable sidebar in Theme Options > Single Product page, and add one of widgets into Appearance > Widgets > Single product page Sidebar.
