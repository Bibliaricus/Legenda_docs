If you use WooCommerce 3.3.x or higher, then use WordPress Customizer (itâ€™s a feature in the WordPress admin) to change the catalog and single product Image settings. 

Go to  Appearance > Customize > WooCommerce > Product Images.

More information about product image settings you can find in [WooCommerce Documentation](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/fixing-blurry-product-images/).

**Note:**
*After these changes, you need to Regenerate Thumbnails to apply them! You can use [Regenerate thumbnails plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) to do this.*
