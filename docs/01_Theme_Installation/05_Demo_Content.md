To make settings up your site easier and faster, you can import Demo Content. There are few ways to import Demo Content: <br />
\- One-click installation using the Setup Wizard <br />
\- Default One-click installation <br />
\- Default import of .xml files <br />

**One-click installation using the Setup Wizard** <br />

Use this method to avoid any issues with the theme’s installation.
The Setup Wizard is a multi-step wizard that enables you to go back and forth one page at a time. You can skip some of the steps, but we recommend entering all the required information before proceeding to the next step.

**Default One-click installation** <br />

This allows you to import pages, posts, projects, slider, simple menu, theme versions, or additional pages from our demos. You will need to import Base Demo Content before proceeding to the theme version’s import. To import Demo Content, follow these steps:
\- Activate Legenda;

\- Go to Theme Options > Import Demos select Base Content to import posts, projects, products, and simple menu. Press the install Base Content button.
Wait until you see the Success message. Then install the desired version.

Now you can regenerate demo images into the appropriate sizes for selected areas. Install the Regenerate Thumbnails plugin, navigate to Tools > Regenerate Thumbnails tab, and Regenerate All Thumbnails. This can take several minutes depending on the server speed and the number of images you have.

**Note:**
*Shop, Cart, Checkout, My account etc are WooCommerce pages and should be provided for you after WooCommerce plugin activation. If you didn't install them automatically, create pages manually <https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-pages/>*

**Default import of .xml files** <br />

If you don't want to import all our dummy content, or you just need separate pages from our demo, or if you can't use one-click import according to the server settings, Import of .XML files is your best option. We’ve included all the demo versions and additional pages in the Import to XML Files folder of the theme’s package, and you can download it from the Downloads page. In XML files folder you'll be able to see the theme’s .xml files and Revolution Slider archive files. legenda Theme Options can also be imported by copying the text file and pasting its content into the Import from File field on the Import/Export tab in Legenda Theme Options.

**Note:** <br />
*\- Folder wp-content/uploads should have permissions 777 <br />
\- Download and import file attachments should be checked <br />*
