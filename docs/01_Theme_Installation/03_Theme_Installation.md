You can install the theme in either of two ways, but first make sure your system meets the previously described [requirements](/Theme_Installation/Legenda_Theme_Requirements).

**Method 1 – WordPress admin dashboard** <br />
\- Navigate to Appearance > Themes > Add New. <br />
\- Choose Legenda_Theme_v.x.x.zip file. Press the Install Now button to upload and install the theme. <br />
\- Use the Legenda Setup Wizard to continue the installation. <br />

The Setup Wizard is a multi-step wizard that enables you to go back and forth one page at a time. You can skip some of the steps, but we recommend entering all the required information before proceeding to the next step.

**Note:**
*Theme activation and installation of required plugins are obligatory!*

**Note:**
*If you get an error: “Are you sure you want to do this?”, it usually occurs when either the PHP memory limit or max post size for WordPress has been reached. See [Legenda Theme Requirements](/Theme_Installation/Legenda_Theme_Requirements). The easiest workaround for this is to install Legenda through FTP (see below). Alternatively, you'll need to change several settings, either on WordPress, or on your web host.*

**Method 2 – FTP** <br />
\- Connect Legenda_Theme_v.x.x.zip file and upload the extracted legenda folder to /wp-content/themes/ folder on your server. <br />
\- Navigate to Appearance > Themes and activate Legenda theme. <br />
