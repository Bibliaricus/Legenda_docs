You can also use Legenda as a Portfolio. It is the perfect way to share your artwork, photography, or anything visual you want to display. <br />
Create Portfolio Page and set the page template (under page attributes) to Portfolio. This will be the main page for all your projects.

Then go to Theme Options -> Portfolio and set necessary options.  <br />
You may create New Projects at Portfolio -> Add New.

**Note:**
*If you want to use WPBakery builder to build a project layout, don't forget to select it in the WPBakery settings.*
