Static block is a useful feature that makes adding content to your site easy and convenient. Static blocks allow you to add additional content for products, create footer layouts, facilitate the creation of promo popups, etc. Static blocks can be used anywhere on your site to display text, images, sliders, widgetized sidebars, etc. 

Enable Static blocks in Theme Options > Modules. <br />
Go to  Dashboard > Static Block > Add new, and you'll be able to build a block layout in no time.

**Note:**
*If you want to use WPBakery builder to build a block layout, don't forget to select it in the WPBakery settings.*
