Due to a limitation in WordPress the Mega Menu will not be enabled when you import our demo content. It’s because custom menu settings are not allowed to import.
But follow the steps bellow and you’ll create Mega Menu in no time.

\- Navigate to Appearance > Menus, create and save your menu. *Keep in mind:* if you add new item you will see only default settings first. [Legenda menu options](/General_Information) appear only after saving menu! <br />
\- Only First Level items can enable the Mega Menu. Click the Arrow icon next to any First Parent Level menu item to expand the Option box. In Design drop-down select Full Width/Full Width Open by Click type. <br />
\- Set the Columns option that will determine how many columns will be displayed. <br />
\- Each menu item can have a font awesome icon. Use font awesome class in the name. Ex: fa fa-connectdevelop <br />
\- Second Level menu items will show the title text above each column. But if you don’t want to show the title just check the box Disable title.To make a menu item a Second Level drag the menu item into place below and to the right of the First Parent Level menu item. <br />
\- The Third Level menu item will be the smaller menu items in each column. You can create the Third Level menu the same way as the Second Level. <br />
\- After setting up your menu assign the menu to the Main Menu location in the Theme Locations box at the bottom of the area and press Save Menu button. <br />

Also you can use image in your menu: <br />
\- as background image for the Submenu Area; <br />
\- as Mega Menu column; <br />

To set the background image for the Submenu Area add image for the first level menu item.

To add image as Mega Menu Column select Custom Links on the left hand side and click the Add to Menu button. Move it to Second level of your menu. Select Image Column or Image Column, No Space (if you don’t want margins around the image) from the Design drop-down. Then press on Upload menu item image link and set your image. Fill in URL field in case you need to add link for your image or use # if you don’t need it. Save menu.

**Note:** <br />
*If you have a lot of menu items and can’t save some menu options then you need to increase PHP Max Input Vars. Try to set 5000 or 8000 for example <http://sevenspark.com/wordpress/menu-item-limit>*
